Math 33A Fall 2024

Discussions: Tuesday and Thursday 9-10, Bunche 3170

Office Hours: Thursdays (and Tuesdays unofficially) 10-11 in Mathematical Sciences 2350.

You can also get help in the SMC (MS 3974) at any time it's open. I'll be there Wednesdays 2-3.

I'll caution that the main entrances to the math building are on the 4th and 5th floor, so you have to go down to get to my office. If you enter through the doors that have a big row of vending machines right in front of them, you will have to walk down the hall to get to stairs that take you all the way down (NOT the first stairs you come to).

I'll be posting the discussion problems here, as well as in BruinLearn (Canvas). Remember that these problems aren't graded or collected. They are just designed to give you practice that you can get help for.
